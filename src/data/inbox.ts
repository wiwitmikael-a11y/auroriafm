Of course, we know you're aiming much higher.\n\nYour office at the Commonwealth Grounds is ready. The staff awaits your direction.\n\nMay your tactics be sharp and your players inspired.\n\n- Lord Harrington, AFA President`,

        body: `Gaffer,\n\nAs requested, here's the preliminary file on Magnus Ironfoot of Gearhaven United. He's a powerhouse, a classic Gearhavenite ST built like a steam-golem. His "Overpressure Shot" is known to dent goalposts and keepers' morale in equal measure.\n\n**Strengths:** Raw power, finishing, undeniable physical presence.\n**Weaknesses:** Not the quickest, and his magical affinity is non-existent. He solves problems with force, not finesse.\n\nHe would be a massive asset for breaking down stubborn defences, but acquiring him from a rival like Gearhaven would require a king's ransom in Aurorium Coin. I'll continue to monitor his situation.\n\nRegards,\nElara`,

However, I must warn you that our supply of Quicksilver Elixirs is running low.\n\nIf we plan to face a particularly fast winger from a club like Dragonflame Knights, I recommend we place an order with the Alchemist's Union soon. Their prices have been steep lately.\n\nYours in science,\nRegis`,
